"""Rebuild the newest CHANGELOG section from the commits, dropping merge commits.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
This fleet merges with merge commits rather than squashing. GitHub writes the PR
title into the merge commit *body*, release-please parses that body, and one
change therefore reaches it twice — once as the real commit, once as the merge
commit carrying its title. willow-mcp shipped three releases that way: 2.1.2 and
2.1.4 listed the same fix twice, and 2.1.3 went further — release-please
collapses entries sharing a scope, so the merge commit displaced `0073767` and a
shipped fix went undocumented. jeles 0.5.0 hit the duplicate half.

**IT HAS NOT HAPPENED HERE, AND CANNOT YET.** This repository has no
CHANGELOG.md. It carries tags v0.0.3 through v0.0.9, but no `chore(master):
release` commit exists anywhere in its history and the changelog file has never
been written — so release-please has never actually cut a release here, and
there is nothing for it to have duplicated. This is installed *ahead* of the
problem, on the reasoning that the moment release-please does produce a
changelog, this repo's merge convention makes the duplication immediate.

Said plainly, because it is the honest status: the behaviour of this file is
verified by its tests and by its identical twins in willow-mcp and jeles, and
**not** by having corrected a real changelog here. Its first live run will be
its first live run.

One deliberate difference from those twins: a missing CHANGELOG.md bails with a
readable message rather than a traceback, because here that is the normal state
of the repo rather than a broken checkout. Neither of the others can reach that
branch, which is why they do not carry it.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Rebuilds the topmost section from `git log <previous tag>..HEAD`: every non-merge
commit whose type is not hidden in release-please-config.json, each listed once,
grouped in config order. Merge commits are excluded by construction — a commit
with two parents is never an entry, whatever its body says.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
---------------------
It rewrites only what it fully understands, and bails out loudly otherwise:

  * a heading in the section that is not a configured section name (a breaking
    change produces "⚠ BREAKING CHANGES", whose formatting this does not model);
  * any commit in the range carrying `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer;
  * a previous tag that is not in the repository.

Bailing prints the reason and exits 2. That is deliberate: silently rewriting a
release note it had misread would be a worse failure than the one it fixes.

USAGE
-----
    python tools/changelog_dedup.py            # fix in place
    python tools/changelog_dedup.py --check    # exit 1 if it would change anything
